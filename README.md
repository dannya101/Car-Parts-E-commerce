# How to setup and run project
Hatch project manager should be installed on your local python to run and manage the project dependencies


Once hatch has been set up, you can run "hatch run dev" (make sure to be on in the Car-Parts-E-commerce/app/ folder) to start a local server for testing the API
Hatch should automatically install project dependencies when the local server starts. Once you have started your virtual environment open the fastapi localhost website. 
Once you open the localhost website, add /docs#/ (ex:http://localhost:8000/docs#/) to be able to see each api endpoint in docs format.
